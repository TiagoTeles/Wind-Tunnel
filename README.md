# Wind Tunnel

## About
This repository contains the OpenFOAM case used during my internship at Centro de Investigação da Academia da Força Aérea (CIAFA). The goal of this internship is to conduct CFD modeling and wind tunnel testing  to precisely characterise and quantify wind tunnel induced perturbations at Base Aérea N.º 1 in thirteen weeks.
